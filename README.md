# TFS AI-Powered Financial Assistant & Dashboard

My submission to the $1000 Voiceflow Voice AI Competition.

This AI assistant is designed for your financial institution, offering seamless support for various banking tasks. It enables customers to apply for a card over the phone, securely block or unblock a card with verification, and get answers to company-related inquiries. Additionally, it can proactively call customers to notify them of potential fraudulent transactions.

Additionally, this repository includes a custom-built dashboard that provides an intuitive interface for managing the financial operations. It allows you to view recent calls, access client and card details from the Airtable database, initiate outbound calls, and send SMS messages seamlessly.
